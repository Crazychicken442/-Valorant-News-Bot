# Valorant-News-Bot
Hi! Thanks for checking out my bot! I put a lot of work into and am really happy with how it came out!

The bot's function is to pull the latest news of the game Valorant from Reddit.
Reddit has been one of the most reliable ways that I had gained the latest news about Valorant so I wanted to create a way to post the newest information into my discord as quickly as possible!

The bot has a few functions, mainly providing links to different pages that contain news for the game Valorant. These can all be accessed through different commands.
Additionally, the bot has a search function. This is not something that is directly tied to Valorant, but can still be used to look up information. The command will search Reddit for the most relevant information to what the user is looking for!
The bot also contains a command to pull up the Post-Match Discussions and a command to pull up the latest Valorant News. Much of this kind of news should be automatically posted to the channels, but it can still be used to pull up all recent information in one text box.
Lastly, the main function of the bot is so automatically search Reddit for the latest news, which it does through its background tasks. After being added to a channel on a server, the bot will automatically post the latest news to the channel. All of the news that is sent is from r/VALORANT (with the flair 'News') and r/VALORANTCompetitive (with the flair 'News & Events | Esports'). As well as this, the bot will post the most recent Post-Match Discussions for different Esport events which makes it super easy to view scores and scoreboards of games so that way you can keep up the different teams and tournaments!

I hope to add more features in the future and I plan to work on any and all bugs that exist in bot! Thanks for looking and I hope the bot is helpful to you and your server!
