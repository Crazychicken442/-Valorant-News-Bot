# Valorant News Discord Bot
### This project was created by [@aj-bhatia](https://github.com/aj-bhatia)

#### Goals:

While creating this bot, the goal I had was to create a system to automatically pull the latest news of the game Valorant from Reddit. I chose Reddit as my source of information, because, for me, it has been one of the most reliable sources of information pertaining to Valorant, speculations about the game, or up to date information about esport matches. This helped me decide that by posting up to date information about Valorant directly to Discord, could help thousands of people keep up with the evolving news and headlines that are released about the game!

#### How the Valorant News Bot works:

In order for the bot to properly meet my goals, I created a few different key functionalities that allow it to perform well. The first, are simple commands that allow for quick access to the main [Play Valorant](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/) site, the [r/VALORANT](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/) subreddit, the [r/ValorantCompetitve](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValorantCompetitive/) subreddit, and other useful links to Valorant sites.\
Secondly, I created a set of commands that are able to actually search and filter through Reddit posts on demand, in order to properly return the latest information that was requested, whether that be most recent outcomes of the latest Valorant Esports matches, the top posts from [r/VALORANT](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/) or [r/ValorantCompetitve](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValorantCompetitive/), or searching a subreddit with a specific keyword and returning the search result. This allows for quick access to a lot of different information for all users in any Discord server using the bot!\
Lastly, the main function of the bot is to automatically search Reddit for the latest news, which it does through its background tasks. After being added to a channel on a server, the bot will automatically post the latest news to the channel. All of the news that is sent is from r/VALORANT (with the flair 'News') and r/VALORANTCompetitive (with the flair 'News & Events | Esports'). As well as this, the bot will post the most recent Post-Match Discussions for different Esport events which makes it super easy to view scores and scoreboards of games so that way you can keepup with the different teams and tournaments! If you would like to unsubscribe from any kind of news you are more than welcome to and the bot will only send those with which you have subscribed to!

Since last checked, the bot is in 400+ Discord servers, helping people all around the world stay up to date with Valorant news!
